# Simple Online Shop with React & Redux

This repository contains a simple online shop application built with React and Redux. It was developed as an exercise for a full-stack bootcamp, where I served as a teaching assistant and was responsible for providing solutions to the given exercises. The application has been updated to the newest version of React and showcases a possible approach to solving the exercise.

## The Task

The goal of this project was to consolidate knowledge in React, Redux, and a small part of React Router DOM. Students were given approximately 8 hours to complete this exercise during the full-time bootcamp.

### Shop Features

This simple online shop includes the following features:

- User authentication with login, enabling users to access their shopping cart.
- Shop overview displaying a list of items.
- Ability for users to add items to their shopping cart from the shop overview.
- Real-time update of the shopping cart as soon as an item is added.
- Calculation of individual item prices and the total cart price.

### Bonus Tasks
- Removal of products from the cart.
- Editing the quantity of a product in the cart.
- Adding taxes (not included in this solution).
- Supporting different currencies (not included in this solution).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm run dev`

This command runs the application in development mode. It automatically reloads the page whenever you make changes to the code.
